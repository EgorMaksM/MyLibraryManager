# MyLibraryManager
 
This branch will contain the main project together with Qt UI, thus containing slightly nodified code from PureCPlusPlus branch. Now that I think of that, it would be better to keep this on a separate branch and to leave only the final build on the main branch. I will probably do this in some way in the future, when this is the biggest of my worries.
